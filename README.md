# keyboard_logger_for_couting
This is a sort of keyboard logger that dosent remember the order but the number of time you clicked on keys. 

I made it when i was 12 using the SDL library. Sadly I only recovered the builded version and the .c file.
Windows firewall will probably see it as a virus because of the logger im using. 

The reason I made it was because my father taught I was destroying my keyboard by typing
and at the time I only knew C so I went and made a program to prove him that the key that I was gaming 
on were not even the one that were damaged on my keyboard.
